Download all files and then run them. To run this first run Requirements.txt file to import necessary libraries. It is not necessary to use same dataset use different dataset.

I have run my code in Jupyter Notebook hence it is directly reading the dataset. But if you want to run it on Python IDLE or on VS Code then Update the dataset name with the path where the dataset is stored (in the form of 'C:\Path to downloaded CSV file\Mall_Customers.csv').
